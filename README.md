# NBA-Hackathon
Shiny App for the NBA Data Analytics Hackathon

## Hackathon Prompt: 
Build a tool and / or model to predict the outcomes of shots attempted.
Some ideas include predicting the make / miss outcome of each shot, the potential success of different types of shots that are generated from live game play, or the rebounds that occur as a result of missed shots

## Features
* Uses a Naive Bayes Net to predict outcomes of shots attempted - we determined that only 2 factors mattered: distance from net and distance from closest defender
* Uses 10x cross validation to ensure accuracy in the Naive Bayes Net 

## Notes
* Due to an NDA from the NBA, the actual data files were removed from this project
* Collaborated with Mike Wang, Jennifer Lo, Jeron Chan
